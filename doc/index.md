# Installation / Download

To install Scala and Node.js, follow the [Prerequisites](tutorial/#prerequisites) section of the Getting Started Tutorials.

Scala.js itself is managed by your Scala build tool of choice.
You can follow [the Getting Started instructions](tutorial/scalajs-vite.html#introducing-scalajs) to enable it.
